<h1>eDress - clothes exchange website</h1>
eDress is an online platform for exchanging your clothes with other members. 
If you are bored of your wardrobe and want some new catchy pieces but can't afford it, here you can change your clothes with somebody else for free.
<br>This website was made as a project for Code Institute.
<br>To view the live site press <a href="#">HERE</a>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
It's as simple as you uploading the information and images of your clothes and then when you have something to show you go roam the dashboard of the clothes already there from other users. When you find something you like, you communicate with them if they would like anything from your collection and if yes, then you exchange addresses and send the piece of clothing for each other. It's as simple as that!
<h2>Idea and goals of the website</h2>
eDress is a website born from an idea of saving money as well as Earth, reusing and reducing the influence of huge brands and corporations using second-world countries and their people for their benefit without giving them equal right. More about the ideas eDress is based on you can find by watching a movie <a href="https://truecostmovie.com/">"True Cost"</a>

<h2>UX</h2>
The website was made for people who want to change their fashion fast but don't want to buy so many new clothes or go to the stores. Also for somebody who wants to save some money and be a part of recycling.<br><br>
These user stories were made durring planning stage and were used in creating different features for the website:<br>
<ul>
<li>As a woman, I have a lot of clothes I don't use and would love to change them into something interesting instead of just throwing them out or bringing them to charity.</li>
<li>As a teenager, I am interested in having new clothes to go with fashion but don't have enough space in my closet so, I'd like to exchange them to new ones.</li>
<li>As a starting dizainer, I like to experiment with clothes to make them interesting but it can get expensive quickly so I'd prefer exchanging my made clothes for new ones and getting some feedback.</li>
<li>As a minimalist, I'd like to gift my clothes to both free some space and save on money by exchanging them to other clothes instead of buying new ones.</li>
</ul>
Also, in the planning stage, I created these wireframes. Although, the design and some features changed over the development process.

<h2>Bugs:</h2>

When the graphs are viewed on a smaller device, the graphs shrink and the x axis and y axis in the line chart as well as the row chart starts to be unreadable without zooming the screen in.
Other manual testing:

If the 'Reset All' button is clicked all of the charts will be rendered again;
When selecting a specific category, country, state, etc. other charts are rendered according to the users choice.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
The website was started in the c9 environment and later on transfered and finished in AWS Cloud9. All biger changes were pushed to the staging area and later on pushed to GitHub and Heroku sites.<br>
Heroku was used to host this project. The following method has been used to achieve a good deployment:
<ol>
<li>Set up the initial app</li>
<li>Link the local Git repository to Heroku.</li>
<li>Create a requirements.txt file, which contains a list of the project dependencies</li>
<li>Create a Procfile, the file that tells Heroku how to run the project.</li>
</ol>
